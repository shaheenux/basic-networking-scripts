# Networking Basics Script Library

A collection of **basic-level networking scripts** written for students who are learning scripting for the first time.

This repository focuses on **core networking concepts** such as:
- Network interfaces
- MAC addresses
- IP configuration
- Command-line networking tools
- Simple parsing and logic

All scripts are intentionally kept **simple, readable, and practical**, so learners can:
- Understand what each command does
- Modify scripts without confusion
- Build confidence before moving to advanced topics

## Who This Repository Is For
- Students learning Linux networking
- Beginners learning Bash scripting
- Learners preparing for networking labs
- Anyone who wants hands-on practice with networking fundamentals

## Structure
- Each script is standalone
- No heavy dependencies
- Output is terminal-friendly
- Scripts are designed to be executed directly

## Updates
The repository is updated **from time to time** with new scripts covering additional networking basics.

## Usage
- Read the script
- Understand the commands
- Run it
- Modify it
- Break it
- Fix it

That is the learning process.

## Note
This repository focuses on **fundamentals first**.  
More advanced areas (automation, security, ethical hacking, pentesting) may be added gradually later.
